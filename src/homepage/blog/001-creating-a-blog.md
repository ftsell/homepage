Well here we are; the first blog post on this blog.
And it is about the blog itself â€“ kinda self centered but I wanna write down why I did what I did here :)

In creating a blog I wanted to have the following features:

- Easier writing in a markup language other than HTML while keeping a rich featureset such as code blocks and linkable sections
- Automatic article detection from the filesystem
- Automatic generation of index pages that also allow article filtering and maybe even search
- [IndiWeb](https://indieweb.org/) features such as [WebMention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) and the semantic HTML relevant in that context (See [IndieWeb Building Blocks](https://indieweb.org/Category:building-blocks))
- Permalinks
