        <p>
            Hello there I'm Finn Sell.<br />
            I just finished my <i>Master of Science in Computer Science</i> at the University of Hamburg and consider
            myself an activist and hacker.
            I'm engaging in different working groups at my university in the
            <a rel="external" href="https://hamburg.ccc.de">CCCHH</a> and other political activism.
        </p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
            My main area of expertise is system administration.
            I have experience maintaining a number of servers in different contexts ranging from personal server
            infrastructure and student IT services to business critical applications at my previous employers.
            For this purpose I prefer to use declarative toolings such as <i>Ansible</i>, <i>NixOs</i>, <i>Terraform</i>
            or <i>Kubernetes</i>.<br>
            Apart from direct OS administration I also consider myself to be versed in network protocols
            including low-level ones (e.g. 802.1Q, IP, ...) as well as high-level application protocols such as HTTP.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also versed in software development and maintenance with most of my experience being in web application
            development
            and data processing with python.
        </p>

                        It was more of a manual labor type job; quite different from what I do now which
                        didn't make it any less interesting though and I enjoyed it a lot.
