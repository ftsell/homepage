                This website is coded by me as a hobby project and has gone through many iterations in different
                programming
                languages and framework.<br>
                It has by now evolved into a <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" rel="external">FastAPI</a>
                application.
                The reason is that FastAPI gives me the power to implement exactly what I want while not being
                unnecessarily complex.

                This library implements the <i>Relying Party</i> and <i>Resource Server</i> parts of the OpenID
                Connect specification. It provides integrations into Django and Django-Rest-Framework, supports most
                commonly used OpenID Connect features but is designed to be as easy to use and understand as
                possible.
