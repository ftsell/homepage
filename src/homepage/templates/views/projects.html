        This website is coded by me as a hobby project and has gone through many iterations in different programming
        languages and framework.<br>
        It has by now evolved into a <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" rel="external">FastAPI</a> application.
        The reason is that FastAPI gives me the power to implement exactly what I want while not being unnecessarily complex.

        This library implements the <i>Relying Party</i> and <i>Resource Server</i> parts of the OpenID
        Connect specification. It provides integrations into Django and Django-Rest-Framework, supports most
        commonly used OpenID Connect features but is designed to be as easy to use and understand as
        possible.
