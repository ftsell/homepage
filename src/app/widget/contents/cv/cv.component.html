            This internship was one of the first steps into an IT oriented career at which I was part of Popp's
            internal IT-Department.<br>
            My work there consisted of helping out in maintaining the company infrastructure, refilling printer toner
            (of course) and automating small tasks with Excel Macros.

            I originally went to Canada to improve my english skill (which worked) and got a second family in the
            process. We're still in close contact and have met again a few times over the past years.

            During this internship I helped disassembling and assembling aircraft engines when they underwent
            maintenance in Hamburg.<br>
            It was more of a manual labor type job; quite different from what I do now which didn't make it any
            less interesting though and I enjoyed it a lot.
