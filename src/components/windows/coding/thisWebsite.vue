    <p>The first project coming to mind is this website itself.</p>
    <p>
        It is built on <i>Vue.js</i>, <i>Nuxt</i> and <i>tailwindcss</i>, and is running on a server
        administered by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The source code is accessible on my GitHub as
        <a
            href="https://github.com/ftsell/homepage"
            target="_blank"
            class="text-link_blue underline decoration-link_blue"
            >ftsell/homepage</a
        >.
    </p>
