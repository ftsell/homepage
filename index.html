        <h1>Hello There</h1>
        <p>
          This is the personal homepage of me, Finn Sell, also sometimes called
          <em>ftsell</em>. I'm a computer science student at the University of Hamburg, an activist, a hacker,
          a SysAdmin and sometimes all at once. My expertise and interests are System Administration and
          Automation, Networking (the computer kind) and creating fun applications for whatever seems useful.
          Additionally, I like learning things about privacy, security and how computers work from the ground
          up.
